    The Carnival of Venice is an annual festival held in Venice, Italy. The Carnival ends with the Christian celebration of Lent,
    forty days before Easter, on Shrove Tuesday or Mardi Gras,the day before Ash Wednesday.
    It's said that the Carnival of Venice was started from a victory of the "Serenissima Repubblica" against the Patriarch of Aquileia,
    Ulrico di Treven in the year 1162.
    In the honour of this victory, the people started to dance and gather in San Marco Square.
    Masks have always been an important feature of the Venetian carnival. Traditionally people were allowed to wear them between the festival
    of (St. Stephen's Day, December 26) and the start of the carnival season at midnight of Shrove Tuesday.
    As masks were also allowed on Ascension and from October 5 to Christmas, people could spend a large portion of the year in disguise.
